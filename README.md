# RiskRadar – AI-Powered PPE Compliance & Workplace Safety Monitoring

## Overview

RiskRadar is a computer vision–based workplace safety monitoring system designed to detect Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) compliance in construction and industrial environments using YOLOv8.

The system analyzes images, videos, and live webcam feeds to identify:

* Workers (Persons)
* Safety Helmets (Hardhats)
* Face Masks
* Safety Vests
* Machinery
* Vehicles
* Safety Cones

RiskRadar automatically detects PPE violations and generates real-time visual alerts to improve workplace safety and monitoring.

## PPE Violation Detection

RiskRadar identifies the following workplace safety violations:

| Violation           | Trigger                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Helmet Missing      | NO-Hardhat detected     |
| Mask Missing        | NO-Mask detected        |
| Safety Vest Missing | NO-Safety Vest detected |

Detected violations are highlighted directly on the video stream or image with alert messages.

# Dataset Setup

Download the Construction Site Safety Dataset from Kaggle.

Extract the downloaded dataset and place it inside the project directory as:

```text
RiskRadar/
│
└── dataset/
    ├── train/
    ├── valid/
    ├── test/
    └── data.yaml
```

Verify that your `data.yaml` file exists:

```text
dataset/data.yaml
```

Example:

```yaml
path: dataset

train: train/images
val: valid/images
test: test/images

names:
  0: Hardhat
  1: Mask
  2: NO-Hardhat
  3: NO-Mask
  4: NO-Safety Vest
  5: Person
  6: Safety Cone
  7: Safety Vest
  8: machinery
  9: vehicle
```

# Training the Model

Open:

```python
train_yolo.py
```

Update the dataset path if required.

Start training:

```bash
python train_yolo.py
```

Training results will be saved in:

```text
runs/detect/
```

After training completes:

```text
runs/detect/ppe_yolov8s/weights/best.pt
```

Copy:

```text
best.pt
```

into:

```text
RiskRadar/weights/
```

---

# Running Image Detection

Place test images inside:

```text
test_images/
```

Example:

```text
test_images/image1.jpg
```

```python
IMAGE_PATH = BASE_DIR / "test_images" / "image1.jpg"
VIDEO_PATH = None
```

Run:

```bash
python test_detections.py

# Results

## 1. PPE Detection Output

![PPE Detection Output](README_assets/output_image.jpg)

This image shows RiskRadar detecting workers, safety helmets, masks, safety vests, machinery, and other workplace objects. The system highlights PPE violations such as missing helmets, masks, or safety vests using bounding boxes and alerts.

---

## 2. Training Results

![Training Results](README_assets/results.png)

This graph shows the model's performance during training. The increasing precision, recall, and mAP values indicate that the YOLOv8 model learned to detect PPE equipment accurately, while the decreasing loss values show successful training convergence.

---

## 3. Confusion Matrix

![Confusion Matrix](README_assets/confusion_matrix.png)

The confusion matrix illustrates how well the model distinguishes between different classes. Most predictions appear along the diagonal, indicating that the model correctly identifies PPE equipment and workplace objects with high accuracy.

## 4. Dataset Label Distribution

![Label Distribution](README_assets/labels.png)

This chart shows the distribution of object annotations in the dataset. It provides an overview of how frequently each class appears, helping to understand the dataset composition used for training the model.
